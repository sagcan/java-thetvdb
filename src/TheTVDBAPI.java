/* TODO: CHECK IF SESSIONTOKEN IS VALID */

/**
 * @author Volkan Sagcan
 * @version 1.0
 *          This class represents the unofficial Java wrapper for the "thetvdb JSON-API".
 *          Using the singleton design pattern, it first creates a session token (TODO, auto-detect valid token)
 *          upon creating an instance, which it later needs / uses for a successful communication with the JSON-API.
 *          Furthermore JSON parsing is done with the GSON library while HTTP communications are done with the Apache HttpClient
 *          library.
 *          <p>
 *          As of now the following API calls are supported:
 *          <ul>
 *          <li> search and receive a list of series with basic information such as the name, description, seriesId, etc...
 *          <li> receive detailed information of a <b>specific</b> series via its seriesId
 *          <li> receive detailed information of a <b>specific</b> episode of a series via its seriesId
 *          <li> receive a list of actors of a <b>specific</b> series via its seriesId
 *          <li> receive a list of seasons of a <b>specific</b> series via its seriesId
 *          <li> receive a list of images of a <b>specific</b> series via its seriesId
 *          </ul>
